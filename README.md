# Parallelism and concurrency course @ EPFL 2020

This is my main solution repository for the [**Parallelism and concurrency 2020 course**](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/parallelism-and-concurrency-CS-206?cb_cycle=bama_cyclebachelor&cb_section=sc).

These solutions should lead to a 10 out of 10 for the Functional Programming assignments. 
At least it did in 2020 ;)

You can find tool setup page [here](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs206-2020/blob/master/homeworks/instructions/tools-setup.md) if needed.

## Have fun through this course!
